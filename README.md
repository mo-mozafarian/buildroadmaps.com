ðŸ‘‹ This is Mo! I made  [BuildRoadmaps.com](http://buildroadmaps.com) as a simple way to visually plan projects, manage workload and create milestone estimates. You can use the interface to create a Roadmap, then save it as a PNG and add it to your project briefs, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Slides and so on.

Note that the current version does not save your Roadmaps nor your progress. So if you leave or refresh the page, it gets all reset and youâ€™ll lose all your progress. 

ðŸ‘€Please use [Github Issues](https://github.com/mo-mozafarian/buildroadmaps.com/issues) for comments, feedback, issues and feature requests. 

Iâ€™m only working on this on the weekends but am going to be improving it as I go. You can find me on twitter [@m_mozafarian](http://twitter.com/m_mozafarian) if you have any suggestions or just wanna say hi. ðŸ˜Š

Happy Roadmapping!
