# Happy Roadmapping

ðŸ‘‹ This is Mo! I made  BuildRoadmaps.com as a simple way to visually plan projects, manage workload and create milestone estimates and then export them as PNGs and add them to my project briefs, Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, â€¦ . 
Note that the current version doesnâ€™t save your Roadmaps. So if you leave the page it gets all reset and youâ€™ll lose your progress. 
ðŸ‘€Please use [Github Issues](https://github.com/mo-mozafarian/buildroadmaps.com/issues) for comments, feedback, issues and feature requests. 
Iâ€™m only working on this on the weekends but am going to be improving it as I go. You can find me on twitter [@m_mozafarian](http://twitter.com/m_mozafarian) if you have any suggestions or just wanna say hi.
